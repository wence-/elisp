;;; Commentary:
;; This defines a /show command for ERC, the Emacs IRC Client.  It
;; allows you to type a Lisp form into the ERC prompt.  The form, and
;; the result of its evaluation are then sent to the current channel:
;; For example:

;; >>> /show (let ((x 'a) (y 'b)) (list x y))
;; <lawrence> (let ((x 'a) (y 'b)) (list x y)) => (a b)

;;; Installation:
;; Put this file somewhere in your `load-path', then put
;; (require 'erc-show) in your ~/.emacs or your ERC startup file.

;;; Code:

(defun erc-cmd-SHOW (&rest form)
  "Eval FORM and send the result and the original form as:

FORM => (eval FORM)."
  (let ((string 
         (with-temp-buffer
           (mapc #'(lambda (f) (insert f " ")) form)
           (goto-char (point-min))
           (setq form (read (current-buffer)))
           (let ((res (condition-case err
                          (eval form)
                        (error
                         (format "Error: %s" err)))))
             (insert (format " => %s" res)))
           (buffer-substring-no-properties
            (point-min) (1- (point-max))))))
    (erc-send-message string)))
